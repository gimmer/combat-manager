This is a simple jquery + html web app for managing combat in D&D 5e.

If you came here for good code, it's not here.

My goal was an app that would help me automate the DM side of things, but leave me free to take player input on their turns.
I didn't want something to rolled for the players, or did anything to eliminate their participation in battle (beyond letting them submit math instead of final rolls).

I also didn't want to actually deal with databases of real D&D stuff, due to the legality involved in including stuff people hadn't paid for.

When / If dndbeyond.com opens their API, I'm sure I'd consider using it. For now, we stick to simple stuff.
